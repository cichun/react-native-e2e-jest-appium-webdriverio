In this repo you will find a sample project to showcase how to do E2E testing with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) + [Appium](https://appium.io/) + [WebDriverIO](https://webdriver.io/) for Android and iOS on react-native.

_It's a bit janky but it serves the purpose of showcasing how to a basic setup needs to be correctly wired._

## How to use

First off, make sure that your setup works with Appium. You can follow their [getting started guide](http://appium.io/docs/en/about-appium/getting-started/) for that.

You want to make sure, in particular, to have it installed locally via `npm install -g appium`, and that both `npx appium-doctor --android` and `npx appium-doctor --ios` give you a âœ…

Once you have done that, you can get the repo locally via the classic `git clone git@github.com:kelset/react-native-e2e-jest-appium-webdriverio.git` command (I prefer SSH over HTTP for cloning, but you do you).

then you can navigate right into the codebase via `cd react-native-e2e-jest-appium-webdriverio`, followed by a `yarn install` command to install all the necessary dependencies.

After this, run the app on the Android emulator/ iOS simulator via `yarn android`/`yarn ios` - **you need to do this at least once**.

After the app is on the emulator/simulator and Metro is running, you can open a new terminal window and start the Appium server via `appium`.

Once the server is running, you can use the commands `test:e2e:android` and `test:e2e:ios` to try out the E2E loop, or use `test:e2e:all` to run both one after the other.

### A note on setup

Please make sure that your local emulator/simulator config matches the `e2e` section of the `package.json` or it will fail 'cause it won't be able to connect to the platform.

## Inspiration and resources

Getting this together was quite a bit of work because there aren't many resources around that walk you through the entire setup for React Native Android/iOS - I pieced this sample app together by following and taking bit and pieces from multiple places. In no particular order:

- https://appium.io/docs/en/about-appium/intro/?lang=en
- https://webdriver.io/docs/gettingstarted
- https://appium.io/docs/en/drivers/android-uiautomator2/
- https://appium.io/docs/en/drivers/ios-xcuitest/index.html
- http://93days.me/appium-test-automation-with-jest-and-webdriver-io/
- http://93days.me/testing-react-native-application/
- https://blog.codemagic.io/mobile-testing-appium-react-native-apps/
- https://blog.logrocket.com/testing-your-react-native-app-with-appium/

I was also inspired by a few repos and how they dealt with similar configs:

- https://github.com/garthenweb/react-native-e2etest/blob/master/package.json
